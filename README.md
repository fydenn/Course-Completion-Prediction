# Course Completion Prediction
Online learning platforms face a critical challenge: a high percentage of users abandon courses before completion. For providers, this leads to lost revenue (especially for paid courses or post-completion monetization), inefficient marketing spend (on users unlikely to finish), and reputational risks (due to poor learner experiences). Without understanding why users drop out, companies struggle to retain at-risk learners, optimize course content, or forecast revenue accuratelyâ€”resulting in missed growth opportunities.

My goal is Develop an ML model to predict dropout probability based on behavioral data (engagement time, progress), enabling:

- Targeted interventions: Automated nudges/support for high-risk users.

- Curriculum improvements: Identify and fix pain points in courses.

# Prediction using Machine learning
Metrics for machine learning solution: Pressicion. I chose this metric because it is very important for us to accurately predict whether a user will leave our platform in order to avoid spending more money.

For this case i chose the RandomForestClassifier because it has the advantage of being flexible in terms of data fit, but is less prone to overfitting.
using GridSearchCV I got the following hyperparameters : 
- 'max_depth' = 6,
- 'min_samples_split' = 120,
- 'n_estimators' = 13
